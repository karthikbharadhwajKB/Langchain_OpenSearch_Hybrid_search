    "I have taken LangChain's OpenSearch integration to the next level by adding hybrid search capabilities. Building on the existing OpenSearchVectorSearch class, I have implemented Hybrid Search functionality (which combines the best of both keyword and semantic search). This new functionality allows users to harness the power of OpenSearch's advanced hybrid search features without leaving the familiar LangChain ecosystem. By blending traditional text matching with vector-based similarity, the enhanced class delivers more accurate and contextually relevant results. It's designed to seamlessly fit into existing LangChain workflows, making it easy for developers to upgrade their search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In implementing hybrid search for OpenSearch within the LangChain framework, I also incorporated filtering capabilities. It's important to note that according to the OpenSearch hybrid search documentation, only post-filtering is supported for hybrid queries. This means that the filtering is applied after the hybrid search results are obtained, rather than during the initial search process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** For the implementation of hybrid search, I strictly followed the official OpenSearch Hybrid search documentation. "

For this test, I set the keyword_weight to 1 and the vector_weight to 0 in the hybrid search, effectively giving full weightage to the keyword component. The results from this hybrid search configuration matched those of a plain keyword search, confirming that my implementation can accurately reproduce keyword-only search results when needed. It's important to note that while the results were the same, the scores differed between the two methods. This difference is expected because the plain keyword search in OpenSearch uses the BM25 algorithm for scoring, whereas the hybrid search still performs both keyword and vector searches before normalizing the scores, even when the vector component is given zero weight. This experiment validates that my hybrid search solution correctly handles the keyword search component and properly applies the weighting system, demonstrating its accuracy and flexibility in emulating different search scenarios."

    "For experiment-2, I took the inverse approach to further validate my hybrid search implementation. I set the keyword_weight to 0 and the vector_weight to 1, effectively giving full weightage to the vector search component (KNN search). I then compared these results with a pure vector search. The outcome was consistent with my expectations: the results from the hybrid search with these settings exactly matched those from a standalone vector search. This confirms that my implementation accurately reproduces vector search results when configured to do so. As with the first experiment, I observed that while the results were identical, the scores differed between the two methods. This difference in scoring is expected and can be attributed to the normalization process in hybrid search, which still considers both components even when one is given zero weight. This experiment further validates the accuracy and flexibility of my hybrid search solution, demonstrating its ability to effectively emulate pure vector search when needed while maintaining the underlying hybrid search structure."
